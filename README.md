# ping-pong robot
for LEGO MINDSTORMS Voice Challenge

Ping-pong robot enables you to practice ping-pong by yourself. This robot has five voice commands: "right", "left", "straight", "go" and "ready". When you say "right" or "left", the robot arm turns right or left respectively. When you say "straight", the robot arm looks ahead. When you say "go", the robot shoots a ping-pong ball. When you say "ready", the robot picks up a ball. The ball which will be used in next time rolls automatically because we made a slope.
By giving  these commands to Alexa, you don't have to go close to the pitching machine and  change the settings of it or set obstacles such as buttons to change robot settings near your court. So you can play ping-pong comfortably!
